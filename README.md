Project: 0x1D. C - Binary trees

This project focuses on understanding and implementing binary trees in C programming language. Below are the key points related to this project:
Resources

Read or watch the following resources to gain a better understanding of binary trees:

    Binary tree (note the first line: Not to be confused with B-tree.)
    Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree
    Tree Traversal
    Binary Search Tree
    Data structures: Binary Tree

Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

    What is a binary tree?
    What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
    What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?
    What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree?
    What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?
    What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree?

Copyright - Plagiarism

Ensure to adhere to the following guidelines to maintain integrity and avoid plagiarism:

    Develop your solutions for the tasks independently to fulfill the learning objectives.
    Do not copy and paste someone else’s work.
    Refrain from publishing any content of this project.
    Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

Requirements

Ensure your code meets the following requirements:

    Use only the allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
    Compile all your files on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
    End all your files with a new line.
    Include a README.md file at the root of the folder of the project.
    Follow the Betty style for your code, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
    Avoid using global variables.
    Limit the number of functions per file to no more than 5.
    Utilize the standard library.
    Although provided main.c files are shown as examples, you are not required to push them to your repo.
    Include the prototypes of all your functions in a header file named binary_trees.h.
    Don’t forget to push your header file.
    Ensure all your header files are include guarded.
